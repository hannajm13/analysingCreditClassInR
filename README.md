# Analysing Customer Credit Class In R

## Overview

This project is a University coursework assignment. It explores the application of data analysis techniques using R Studio on a dataset containing bank customers' credit-related information. The dataset contains credit-related information of bank customers and was cleaned only for variables of importance only such as 'employment', 'foreign_worker' and 'job'. The cleaned dataset is provided and the code used to clean the dataset is provided in a separate file. The dataset was explored and multiple data analysis techniques were employed to understand the relationship between selected factors and the credit class of customers. An in-depth discussion of the results of the data analysis techniques is provided in pdf.

## Aim
To analyse how a customer's credit class is affected by their employment duration and type of job they are in.

## Objectives

- To find out the relationship between years of employment and credit class.
- To find out how class is affected when taking into account both employment and job.
- To find out if there are any interactions between job and employment that could affect class and if the impact of job on credit class depends on employment and vice versa.
